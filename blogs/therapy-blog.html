				<h1>How to Get More Out of Therapy</h1>
    			<p>I don't know about you, but I get confused about the different approaches to psychotherapy. What even is psychotherapy? Having a basic understanding of therapeutic strategies can help you in multiple ways. Knowing which practices work for you will help in choosing a therapist. You might look for a therapist that specializes in an approach that you are interested in. If you already are working with a therapist, you could be curious to try a new approach. And with so many options, you might want to explore multiple types, or ask your therapist for recommendations.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://www.apa.org/">American Psychological Association</a> there are five different theories, or categories, of psychotherapy.</p><p><strong>Psychoanalysis and psychodynamic therapies</strong></p><p>Psychoanalytic or psychodynamic psychotherapy draws on practices of analytical psychology and psychoanalysis. This approach will help you understand the underlying meaning of dreams, recurring thoughts, emotions, fantasies, and/or conflicts. This approach will also help explain any resistance to certain feelings. It relies heavily on your relationship with your therapist, because it explores the conscious and unconscious aspects of the therapeutic relationship. This practice requires that the patient trust his or her therapist and be open and honest when divulging information.</p><p><strong>Behavioral therapy</strong></p><p>Behavioral therapy identifies and helps change unhealthy behaviors. The idea behind this form of therapy is that unhealthy behaviors can be changed through learning. Do you feel that you turn to self-destructive behaviors when facing difficult situations or certain uncomfortable thoughts? Behavioral therapy might be a way to retrain your brain. There are multiple types of behavioral therapy including cognitive behavioral therapy, systematic desensitization, aversion therapy, flooding, and functional analytic psychotherapy. Ultimately, behavioral therapy can teach more effective coping mechanisms and help a person respond in a more postive way to stimuli.</p><p><strong>Cognitive therapy</strong></p><p>Cognitive therapy addresses thinking patterns. It aims to adjust dysfunctional emotions and behaviors by correcting the thoughts that generate those emotions and behaviors. These negative thoughts about oneself, others, or the world are often automatic and ingrained. Using cognative therapy, one can master techniques that defeat or invalidate these automatic thoughts. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a system drawing from both the cognitive and behavioral therapy - combining these two approaches often attains results.</p><p><strong>Humanistic therapy</strong><p>Humanistic therapy helps patients reach their maximum potential through genuine concern and supportive care. Therapists themselves will focus on the strengths of the patient and highlight the patient\'s innate goodness. Topics covered include: How can you live in the present moment? How can you accept your current situation? How can you reach self-actualization? How can you impact the world? This approach will also build on your sense of self. If you are interested in existentialism, this is a category of psychotherapy to try.</p><p><strong>Integrative or holistic therapy</strong></p><p>Integrative/holistic therapy calls attention to the relationshhip between the mind, body, and spirit. Integrative therapists feel that a blended approach best treats each client. Holistic therapist could use bodywork techniques in order to release emotions.</p>
