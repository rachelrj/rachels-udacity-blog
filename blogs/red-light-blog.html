				<h1>Red Light Therapy for Your Skin</h1>
				<p>You may have heard of red light therapy as a treatment for your skin. Is it a fad? Does it really benefit your skin? What else is it supposedly good for?</p>
			    <p>Yes. Red light therapy is great for your skin. But when I asked my dermatologist at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.azealderm.com/">Azeal Dermatology Institute</a> she said it\'s like working out. You need to regularly go to red light therapy for it to be beneficial.</p>
			    <p>So what exactly is red light therapy?</p>
			    <p>First of all, <strong>this is NOT the same light as in a tanning booth.</strong> And it does NOT expose you to damaging UV rays. According to <a href="https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/red-light-therapy" target="_blank">WebMD</a>, red light therapy helps the mitochondria in your cells make more energy. So, this is why experts believe that red light helps cells repair themselves and become healthier.</p>
			    <p>Red light therapy is also called photobiomodulation (PBM). And this is what it\'s been called at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.restore.com/locations/co-boulder-co006">Restore Hyper Wellness</a> where I\'ve received the treatment.</p>
			    <p>There have been hundreds of clinical studies and thousands of laboratory studies conducted. According to <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/red-light-therapy#evidenced--based-benefits" target="_blank">Healthline</a>, these are some of the evidence-based benefits: 
			    	<ul>
			    		<li>Promotes wound healing</li>
			    		<li>Improves hair growth in people with androgenic alopecia</li>
			    		<li>Helps for the short-term treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome</li>
			    		<li>Stimulates healing of slow-healing wounds</li>
			    		<li>Reduces psoriasis lesions</li>
			    		<li>Aids with short-term relief of pain and morning stiffness in people with rheumatoid arthritis</li>
			    		<li>Reduces some of the side effects of cancer treatments</li>
			    		<li>Improves skin complexion and builds collagen</li>
			    		<li>Helps to mend sun damage</li>
			    		<li>Prevents recurring cold sores from herpes simplex virus infections</li>
			    		<li>Helps diminish scars</li>
			    		<li>Relieves pain and inflammation</li>
			    	</ul>
			    	<p>Check with your doctor or provider before trying red light therapy. If you do, send us a message and let us know how you feel afterwards. I know I feel quite warm and refreshed!</p>
