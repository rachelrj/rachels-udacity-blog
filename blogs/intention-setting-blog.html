				<h1>5 Intention Setting Journal Prompts for January</h1>
    			<p>Creating a daily intention journal should be a consideration if you're planning on improving your health and wellness in 2023. Why? You are 42 percent more likely to achieve a goal if you write it down! This statistic was determined in <a href="https://www.dominican.edu/dominicannews/study-highlights-strategies-for-achieving-goals"> an academic study</a> by psychology professor Dr. Gail Matthews. Moreover, its difficult to stick to a long-term, large-scale goal. On the other hand, if you set smaller, attainable goals, youâ€™ll be far more likely to stay motivated over time.</p><p>Convinced yet? If so, here are a few prompts for your journal-writing New Year's resolution:</p><p><strong>1) What have you been complaining most about lately? How can you change this?</strong></p><p>Personally, I've been shocked and scared about the in the midst of the catastophes happening recently. There are steps I can personally take (besides donating or becoming a first responder!). One thing I've starting on my own to improve my ecological footprint is using <a href="https://us.whogivesacrap.org/">Who Gives a Crap</a> for my toilet paper and using <a href="https://www.earthbreeze.com/products/earthbreeze-ecosheets-laundry-detergent">eco friendly laundry sheets</a> for my detergent. These are small, easy changes.</p><p><strong>2) What might be the next step towards accomplishing a career goal? What can you do now?</strong></p><p>Maybe you have your eye on a promotion within the next two years. Or want to discuss boosting your salary at your next quarterly review. What examples might you give your boss to warrant that raise or promotion? Could you read a book related to your career, or a book about leadership in general? Or is there a new skill you could start learning? Or maybe just today, smile and have a chat with a co-worker that you wouldn't normally. Nothing is too small!</p><p><strong>3) Have you tried meditation? How does it make you feel?</strong></p><p>Have you incorporated mediation into your daily routine? If so, write a journal entry about how you felt after your daily meditation. Do you feel more clear-headed? Has your outlook on the day improved? If you aren't a daily meditator, try a short morning mediation. The <a href="https://www.calm.com/">calm app</a> has a few free mediations to try.</p><p><strong>4) Is there someone you've been meaning to catch up with? Meaning to call?</strong></p><p>Are there important friends or family of yours that you haven't spoken to in over a year? I am one that is guilty of losing touch with friends. There are so many ways that relationships can deteriorate. Don't let it be because of lack of effort! So today, give that friend a call. Or at least shoot that person a message to show that you are thinking of him or her!</p><p><strong>5) How can you practice 'everyday creativity' today? Report your mood.</strong></p><p>Focus on creativity today. How can you express yourself at work? Or at home? <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17439760.2016.1257049">A recent study</a> has shown that spending time on creative goals during a day is associated with higher activated positive affect on that day. Some ideas for your creative endeavour include: painting a picture, writing a poem, creating a vision board, planning a surprise, or even rearranging/tidying your living space!</p></br><p>So, instead of the standard 'lose five lbs' goal that you set every year, do something more intentional for your New Year's resolution. Grab a nice journal that gets your motivational juices flowing at the store today. Set those small intentions that will lead to meaningful changes over time.</p>
